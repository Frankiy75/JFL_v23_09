# ZigZag Indicator Fixes Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pivot Calculation Logic
**Problem**: The ZigZag indicator was not properly validating pivot points before confirming them, leading to premature or invalid pivot detection.

**Solution**: 
- Added `IsPivotConfirmed()` function that checks `InpConfirmBars` parameter
- Modified `Scan()` function to only add pivots after proper confirmation
- Validates that no higher/lower values occur in the confirmation period

### 2. Extreme Validation
**Problem**: Current extremes were not validated for reasonableness, potentially causing invalid ZigZag lines.

**Solution**:
- Added `ValidateCurrentExtreme()` function to check extreme validity
- Resets invalid extremes to prevent erroneous ZigZag drawing
- Validates extremes against recent price action and time constraints

### 3. Line Interpolation
**Problem**: ZigZag was only drawing points at pivot locations without connecting lines, causing disconnected visualization.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `DrawZigZag()` to call `InterpolateLine()` between consecutive pivots
- Improved `InterpolateLine()` to create smooth continuous lines
- Added interpolation from last confirmed pivot to current extreme

### 4. Buffer Synchronization
**Problem**: Complete buffer clearing on each update caused inefficiency and potential visual flickering.

**Solution**:
- Optimized buffer management to only clear changed sections
- Added static tracking to prevent unnecessary full buffer clears
- Improved direction buffer propagation for better synchronization

### 5. Redraw Conditions
**Problem**: Too aggressive validation triggers caused excessive redraws and performance issues.

**Solution**:
- Increased validation tolerance from 2 to 10 points
- Added conditional cleanup based on change significance
- Reduced frequency of unnecessary pattern validations

## Key Functions Modified

1. **Scan()** - Enhanced pivot confirmation logic
2. **DrawZigZag()** - Added line interpolation and optimized buffer management
3. **InterpolateLine()** - Fixed interpolation algorithm for smooth lines
4. **OnCalculate()** - Added extreme validation and improved update conditions

## New Functions Added

1. **IsPivotConfirmed()** - Validates pivot points with confirmation bars
2. **ValidateCurrentExtreme()** - Ensures current extremes are reasonable

## Parameters Used

- `InpConfirmBars = 3` - Number of bars required to confirm a pivot point
- Validation tolerance increased to reduce unnecessary updates
- Buffer clearing optimized for better performance

## Expected Results

1. ZigZag lines should now properly connect pivot points
2. Pivot detection should be more accurate with proper confirmation
3. Reduced visual flickering and improved performance
4. More stable extreme tracking and validation
5. Better synchronization between different indicator buffers

## Testing Recommendations

1. Load the indicator on different timeframes (M5, M15, H1, H4, D1)
2. Verify that ZigZag lines connect properly between pivot points
3. Check that pivot points are detected with proper confirmation
4. Monitor performance to ensure reduced CPU usage
5. Validate that extreme lines are drawn accurately
